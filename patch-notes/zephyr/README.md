## v1.8.187

### August 22, 2024

_This update includes exciting new features like Map View and Input Curves, improved lighting in some scenarios, and the customary assortment of bug fixes._

**New Features ‚ú®**

* Map View
  * Added a Map View option, granting users a top-down view of the scenario
  * Toggling on Map View is mapped to `M` by default
    * _**NOTE:**_ If a user has existing custom mapped inputs, they may need to navigate to Main Menu -> Controller -> Mapping and manually set the "Toggle Map" input
* Thermal Camera
  * Drone Thermal Camera View is now available as a fully released feature
  * Toggling thermal vision is mapped to `T` by default
    * _**NOTE:**_ If a user has existing custom mapped inputs, they may need to navigate to Main Menu -> Controller -> Mapping and manually set the "Toggle Thermal" input
* Input Curves (Preview)
  * Added initial implementation of the Input Curve system containing five different profiles. An Input Curve profile changes how sensitive different analog inputs, such as flight and camera controls, are at various stages of input.
  * While the current system does not allow for editing profiles, future updates to this system will add the ability to manually configure Input Curve profiles
    * _**NOTE:**_ The "Linear" profile is the standard Input Curve profile

**Improvements** üôå

* Scenario Updates
  * Updated lighting across multiple scenarios to improve visual quality

**Bug Fixes üêõ**

* Fixed an issue preventing certain controllers from working on Mac systems
* Fixed an issue with objective completion timing in the Tutorial and The Yard scenarios
* Updated objective text descriptions in the Tutorial and The Yard scenarios
* Fixed an issue where drone camera zoom would persist after switching modules and drones
* Fixed a visual issue impacting the guide drones for multiple drones
* Fixed an issue impacting the guide drone for the M200
* Updated the drone roster for the Zig Zag module in the Parking Lot scenario
* Fixed floating foliage in the NIST Park scenario
* Updated the text description for the ANAFI USA
* Updated all references from Skydio X2D to Skydio X2E
* Fixed an issue impacting the Basic Training landing modules&#x20;
* Fixed an issue impacting the Alta X's ability to takeoff in the Bridge Inspection scenario
* Fixed a visual issue impacting the "ghost drone" in the Ball Collector module in the Kids With Drones scenario
* Fixed an issue impacting log files displaying erroneous scenario information

Known Issues ‚ùó

## v1.8.155

### January 19, 2024 <a href="#id-1.8.55-january-19-2024" id="id-1.8.55-january-19-2024"></a>

## v1.8.154

### January 18, 2024 <a href="#id-1.8.54-january-18-2024" id="id-1.8.54-january-18-2024"></a>

_This update includes a rework to the Tutorial scenario, a new flyable drone, and multiple squashed bugs._

**New Features ‚ú®**

* Updated Scenarios
  * Tutorial
    * We split the Tutorial scenario into four smaller modules instead of one enormous module. This greatly improved performance and will allow users to access desired sections of the tutorial quicker.
    * We updated the environmental art of the tutorial, switching from an empty void to a furnished gymnasium. Even if you completed the original tutorial before, it is worth checking out the new flyable area.
    * We updated the scenario and module selection art to reflect the environmental art changes.
* New Flyable Drones
  * DJI Matrice 30
    * The Matrice 30 from DJI is respected and trusted commercial drone model. Portable, rugged, and powerful, the Matrice 30 (M30) has nearly as many use cases as it does users.
* New Authorization System
  * Integrated Zephyr‚Äôs authorization system with new authorization system featured on the Zephyr website.

**Bug Fixes üêõ**
