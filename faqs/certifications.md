<details>

<summary>What are the requirements to fulfill a certification?</summary>

Each certification has varying requirements. Some may require a minimum amount of flight time, others may require a video recording of a flight attempt.

For example, the APSA Virtual BPERP Certification requires the pilot to record their screen and camera while they attempt the BPERP Scenario Test. That recording is then saved to a shareable platform and submitted as their certification attempt on Zephyr. Once the attempt is reviewed by a BPERP Proctor, te pilot will receive a status update on their certification.

Other certifications may require a level of currency to maintain the "Current" status. For example, if a certification requires a certain number of flight hours in the simulator each month, you will need to make sure that you meet those requirements. Your certification's status will not be "Current" until you meet those requirements.
