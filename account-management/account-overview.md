## K12 Accounts

In some cases, an institution on Zephyr may qualify as a "K12" institution, an institution where the students are generally considered under the age of 18. This feature was introduced to the platform as a way to maintain COPPA compliance.

If an institution is marked as K12, the students that register under that institution will be flagged as a "K12 Student."

K12 students will have limited access to features on the Zephyr site to safeguard the student against services that have been deemed inappropriate for their age.

## Password Rotation Policies

Some institution policies require a password rotation mandate for their users. Zephyr allows an institution-wide password rotation policy to be set for all users that belong to the institution.

Rotation Options are Not Required, 90, 180, and 365 days.

{% hint style="info" %}
In cases where a user belongs to two institutions with password rotation policies, the institution with the stricter policy will be used.

For example, if a user belongs to one institution with a 90 day rotation policy and another institution with a 365 day rotation policy, the 90 day rotation policy will be used.
