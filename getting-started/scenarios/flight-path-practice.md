## Out and Back

Fly the indicated path as precisely and smoothly as possible.  You will be graded based on the precision of your flight path, smoothness of your velocity, and maintaining correct nose orientation.  Hovering in place will progress objective steps even if you are in the incorrect location.

The Objectives in Out and Back that you need to complete are:

1. Take off and hover in the indicated spot at 6.5ft
2. Fly straight out following the arrows closely for 10 meters
3. Hold and hover at 6.5ft in the center of the ring
4. Fly straight back following the arrows closely for 10 meters
5. Hold and hover at 6.5ft in the center of the ring
6. Land the drone as closely as you can to the center of the starting point

## Figure 8

Fly the indicated path as precisely and smoothly as possible.  You will be graded based on the precision of your flight path, smoothness of your velocity.  Hovering in place will progress objective steps even if you are in the incorrect location.

The objectives in Figure 8 you'll need to complete are:

1. Take off and hover in the indicated spot at 6.5ft
2. Fly a figure 8
   1. Fly a figure 8 along the path. Hover back in the center when you are done
3. Land the drone at the starting point

## Rectangle

Fly the indicated path as precisely and smoothly as possible.  You will be graded based on the precision of your flight path, smoothness of your velocity.  Hovering in place will progress objective steps even if you are in the incorrect location.

The objectives in Rectangle you'll need to complete are:

1. Take off and hover in the indicated spot at 6.5ft
2. Fly a rectangle
3. Land the drone at the starting point

## Circuit

Fly the indicated path as precisely and smoothly as possible.  You will be graded based on the precision of your flight path, smoothness of your velocity.  Hovering in place will progress objective steps even if you are in the incorrect location.

The objectives in Circuit you'll need to complete are:

1. Take off and hover in the indicated spot at 6.5ft
2. Fly a circuit
3. Land the drone at the starting point
