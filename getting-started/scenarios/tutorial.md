# üèÄ Tutorial

## Introduction

The tutorial contains 4 modules that will help walk you through the basics of controlling a Drone, and the basics of a Zephyr Scenario and Module.  Modules are comprised of different types of objectives that must be completed.

1. Drone Power and Basic Control
2. Guide Drone, Flight Modes, and Control Modes
3. Camera Controls
4. Objectives

For all of the modules we will use the Phantom 4

## Drone Power and Basic Controls

To power on the drone move the sticks or press the keyboard keys into the positions shown on the screen and hold them there for 2 seconds.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To change altitude press up on the left `Left Stick` or `W` on the keyboard to increse the throttle and make the drone gain altitude.  Increase altitude until your drone reaches the purple box.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now press down on the `Left Stick` or `S` on the keyboard to decrease the throttle and make the drone lose altitude.  Decrease altitude until your drone reaches the purple box.

Rotation around the up and down axis of a drone is called yaw. To change the yaw of the drone press the `Left Stick` Right or Left, `A` or `D` on the keyboard.

Try spinning the drone around 3 times

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Rotation around the Left to Right axis is known as pitch.

To change the pitch of the drone press the `Right Stick` up or down or press the `Up` or `Down` arrow keys on the keyboard.

Move the drone forward to the purple box then move backward into the other purple box.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
In most flight modes the drone will move relative to the direction it is facing, NOT the way the user is facing.  If the operator changes the pitch the drone will move forward/backward relative to itself, as seen to the bottom right corner (Drone Camera).
{% endhint %}

Try changing the yaw of the drone and pitching forward or backward to reach the purple boxes

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Rotation around the forward to backward axis is known as roll. To chane the roll of the drone, press the `Right Stick` left or right or press the `Right` or `Left` arrow keys on the keyboard.

Try moving the drone into both of the purple boxes.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now try changing the yaw of the drone and rolling left or right to reach the purple boxes

Congratulations! you know understand the basics of piloting a drone.  Please spend some time trying out the full range of controls.

## Guide Drone, Flight Modes, and Control Modes

### Guide Drone

A large overlay that shows the orientation of the drone can be toggled on or off with left shift on the keyboard. This allows the user to control the drone better when it is far away.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Use the overlay to pilot the drone to the two purple boxes.

### GPS Mode

{% hint style="info" %}
To switch modes press `F1` on the keyboard
{% endhint %}

In GPS Mode the drone will adjust itself to maintain its position in space when the operator stops giving input.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Attitude Mode (ATTI)

{% hint style="info" %}
To switch modes press `F1` on the keyboard
{% endhint %}

In ATTI mode the drone has no positional stabilization, so it tends to drift after the operator stops giving input.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
To switch control modes press `F2` on the keyboard
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not all flight modes are available on all drones in Zephyr
{% endhint %}

### CourseLock Mode

The forward direction of the drone when it enters CourseLock mode will always remain its forward direction.  Thus the same input will always make the drone move in the. same direction regardless of yaw.

### HomeLock Mode

The point the drone entered HomeLock mode becomes its home point.  Vertical input on the right stick will change the drones distance from its home point, and horizontal input will cause the drone to circle its home point.

## Camera Controls

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not all drones in Zephyr have the ability to move their cameras up and down
{% endhint %}

To switch cameras press the button on the back left of the transmitter or `Spacebar` on the keyboard.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To move the drone camera up and down turn the dials on the transmitter up and down or press the `Home` and `End` keys on the keyboard.

## Objectives

### Path Objective

In this module we learn the first type of objective which is the Path objective.  The goal is to ocmplete the path objectives in sequence from left to right.  And indicator will appear on the blue cube and begind to fill as we approach it.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Zone Objective

With a Zone objective the user must pulot the drone into the objective and remain there until the objective completes.  We'll need to stay in the purple box for 5 seconds.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Zone objectives may also appear as brackets or rings.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Target Objective

First will need to pilot the drone into the zone objective.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once inside the Zone Objective crosshairs will appear on the drone camera.  Point the drones camera at the soccer ball.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you point the drone camera at the soccer ball, keep it centered in the crosshairs until the objective completes

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Landing Objective

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Pilot the drone over the objective then lower the drone to the ground.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Continue to hold down on altitude (Left Stick in the down position) to power down the drone.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Some landing objectives may not require the drone to be powered off in order to be completed.
{% endhint %}
